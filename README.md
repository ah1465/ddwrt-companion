DD-WRT Companion
===============

The overall rationale behind this repository is to provide building blocks for OpenSource mobile apps dedicated to manage various routers and embedded devices with various firmwares.
I started this project as a means for myself to get started with native apps on most mobile operating systems.

At this time, I am targetting [DD-WRT](http://www.dd-wrt.com) routers, but the implementation aims at being flexible enough to support other firmwares (Tomato, OpenWRT, ...) and their variants.

DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative OpenSource firmware suitable for a great variety of WLAN routers and embedded systems. 

This mobile DD-WRT Companion lets you connect to, monitor and manage your DD-WRT routers on the go. 
It requires SSHd to be enabled on the router, and works with both private key and password based authentication methods.
