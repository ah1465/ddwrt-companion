DD-WRT Companion
===============

The overall rationale behind this repository is to provide building blocks for Open-Source mobile apps dedicated to manage various routers with various firmwares. 
At this time, we target DD-WRT routers, but the implementation aims at being flexible enough to support other firmwares (Tomato, OpenWRT, ...) and their variants.

This mobile DD-WRT Companion lets you connect to, monitor and manage your DD-WRT routers. 
It requires SSHd to be enabled on the router, and works with both private key and password-based authentication methods.
