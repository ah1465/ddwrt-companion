ddwrt-companion
===============

This repository aims at building Open-Source mobile apps for managing various routers with various firmwares. At this time, we target DD-WRT routers, but the implementation is flexible enough to support other firmwares (Tomato, OpenWRT, ...) and their variants.

This mobile DD-WRT Companion lets you connect to, monitor and manage your DD-WRT routers. 
It requires SSHd to be enabled on the router, and works with both private key and password-based authentication methods.
